# Relational-Data

Relational-Data is a project, that is used to check dependencies among the lines of a C code.
It tells you, what variables depend on others, and what instance of the variable is being taken.

One needs to put the test C file in inputf.in and then run as following:
g++ indent.cpp
g++ -o token tokenize.cpp
./token

Please feel free to suggest changes to our project and share your comments.
